# Form A Story

## About

Codecademy on-platform project. Used knowledge of HTML forms to grab user inputs and put a spin on a classic story. Essentially had to make sure that the correct information was collected so that the story made sense!

Note, much of the HTML, CSS and JavaScript was already provided as the main focus was on HTML forms. 

Should be a useful reference in the future.
